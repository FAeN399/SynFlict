# Image Prompt: Hex Card Forge - The Scriptorium (Card Editor)

Create a digital illustration showcasing the Scriptorium screen of the Hex Card Forge application, which serves as the card creation and editing interface.

## Visual Style
- **Art Style**: Dark fantasy/mystical interface with a clean, modern aesthetic
- **Medium**: Digital UI design illustration
- **Color Palette**: 
  * Primary: Rich Byzantine Purple (#4A0072)
  * Secondary: Goldenrod (#DAA520)
  * Background: Dark Imperial Blue (#1A1A2E)
  * Content Areas: Darker (#252538) and slightly lighter (#2C2C44) shades
  * Text: Light Gray (#E0E0E0) and Medium Gray (#B0B0B0)

## Key Elements to Include

1. **Overall Layout**:
   - Split screen design with form inputs on the left and card preview on the right
   - Top navigation bar with app logo and menu items
   - Hexagonal elements as design motifs throughout the interface

2. **Left Panel - Form Inputs**:
   - Dark content area (#252538) with clearly organized form sections
   - Form title "CRAFT YOUR CARD" in golden text
   - Input fields for:
     * Card Name (text input)
     * Card Type (dropdown selector)
     * Cost (number input)
     * Rarity (dropdown with color indicators)
     * Description (multi-line text area)
     * Tags/Keywords (multi-select field)
   - "Upload Image" button with golden border
   - "Generate Card" and "Save Card" buttons with purple/gold styling
   - One form field should appear active/focused with a golden glow

3. **Right Panel - Card Preview**:
   - Large hexagonal card preview with golden border
   - Card displaying sample data that matches the form inputs
   - Card elements include:
     * Header with name and cost
     * Central image area with placeholder art
     * Card type and rarity indicators 
     * Description text in an elegant scroll-like area
     * Footer with copyright/attribution text
   - Subtle glow effect around the preview card

4. **Visual Effects**:
   - Magical particles or energy effects flowing between the form inputs and card preview
   - Animated highlights on the currently selected form field
   - Shimmering effect on the card border to indicate it's a live preview
   - Depth through subtle shadows and layering

## Mood & Atmosphere
Create a focused, creative workspace that feels like a digital scriptorium or enchanted design studio. The interface should convey the sense of magical craftsmanship, where inputs on the left manifest as a finished card on the right. The dark theme creates contrast that makes the card preview pop while reducing eye strain during extended editing sessions.

## Additional Notes
- Show the screen in a desktop aspect ratio (16:9)
- Include subtle UI hints like tooltips or helper text
- Demonstrate responsive form elements (dropdown open, text being entered)
- The UI should feel polished and premium while maintaining the arcane aesthetic
