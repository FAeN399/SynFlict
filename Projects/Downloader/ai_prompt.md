# Reddit Media Grabber: AI Development Prompt

## Project Overview
You are continuing development on the Reddit Media Grabber, a Python application that downloads media content (images, videos, GIFs, and articles) from Reddit. The application offers both command-line and graphical interfaces with features for single post downloads, subreddit-specific downloads, global Reddit searches, and subreddit tracking.

## Current Project State

### Architecture
- Backend modules in `grabber/` package
- PySide6-based GUI in `gui.py` and modern implementation in `modern_gui.py`
- Command-line tools in various Python scripts
- Configuration via `config.ini`

### Implemented Components
1. **Authentication System**
   - PRAW-based Reddit API authentication
   - Support for username/password and 2FA
   - Mock mode for testing without credentials

2. **Media Downloading**
   - ThreadPoolExecutor-based download queue
   - Support for images, videos, and GIFs
   - Progress tracking and history

3. **Search & Filter**
   - Global Reddit search with keyword filtering
   - Subreddit-specific downloads with sorting options
   - Media type, time period, and NSFW filtering

4. **GUI**
   - Tab-based navigation
   - Queue and history views
   - Settings and configuration panel
   - Material design-inspired interface

## Current Priorities

1. **Fix AttributeError Issues**
   - The application has been experiencing AttributeError related to missing attributes
   - Ensure all UI components, especially in the Settings tab, are properly initialized
   - Focus on fixing any remaining initialization bugs in the ModernMainWindow class

2. **Complete Modern GUI Implementation**
   - Finish implementing all tabs in the modern UI (modern_gui.py)
   - Connect UI controls to backend functionality
   - Ensure responsive design for different window sizes

3. **Backend Integration**
   - Wire all backend logic into GUI controls
   - Implement proper error handling and feedback mechanisms
   - Ensure thread safety for download operations

4. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Implement light/dark theme toggle
   - Add proper progress indicators for downloads
   - Improve feedback for authentication failures

## Design Guidelines
- Follow the purple (#9C27B0) and yellow (#FFC107) color scheme
- Maintain Material Design principles throughout the UI
- Support both light and dark themes
- Prioritize user feedback for all operations
- Ensure NSFW content controls are robust and intuitive

## Testing Approach
- Follow the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach established in the project
- Use mock mode for testing without actual Reddit API access
- Ensure all new features have corresponding tests

## Additional Resources
- Review `project_handoff.md` and `extensive_project_handoff.md` for detailed context
- Consult `ui_design_prompt.md` for UI design specifications
- Check `prompt_plan.md` for the feature roadmap
- Test Reddit API credentials with `test_reddit_auth.py` before development

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Test the application to verify that the AttributeError issues have been resolved
2. Complete the Settings tab functionality and ensure all UI controls work properly
3. Implement proper thread safety for download operations
4. Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback
5. Ensure consistent styling across all parts of the application

Your task is to continue development on this project, addressing the priorities outlined above while maintaining the established architecture and design principles.
