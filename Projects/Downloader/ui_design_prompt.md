# Reddit Media Downloader UI Design Prompt

## Project Overview
I'm building a Reddit media downloader application called "Reddit Grabber" that allows users to download images, videos, GIFs, and other media from Reddit posts, subreddits, and global searches. I need a beautiful, modern UI design that's intuitive and visually appealing.

## Key Features to Include

1. **Multiple Download Methods**:
   - Single post download (from URL)
   - Subreddit-specific downloads with sorting options (hot, new, top, rising, controversial)
   - Global Reddit search with keyword filtering
   - Subreddit synchronization

2. **Media Filtering Options**:
   - Media types (images, videos, GIFs, articles)
   - Time period filters (hour, day, week, month, year, all)
   - NSFW content toggle
   - Result limit settings

3. **Download Management**:
   - Download queue with progress indicators
   - Download history with status tracking
   - Ability to cancel/retry downloads

4. **Settings**:
   - Reddit API credentials management
   - Default download directory
   - Rate limiting configuration
   - Theme selection

## Design Requirements

### Color Scheme
- **Primary Color**: Purple (#9C27B0 or similar vibrant purple)
- **Secondary Color**: Yellow (#FFC107 or similar bright yellow)
- **Background**: Light theme and dark theme options

### Layout
- The application should open in full-screen mode by default
- Use a modern, clean interface with clear visual hierarchy
- Implement a tabbed interface for different functionalities
- Include responsive elements that adapt to window resizing

### Design Elements
- Card-based design for content items
- Modern, flat UI elements with subtle shadows
- Custom icons for primary actions
- Progress indicators that match the overall design language
- Intuitive input controls (dropdowns, toggles, text fields)
- Visual feedback for user actions

### Specific Screens to Design
1. **Main Download Screen**:
   - Single post download section
   - Subreddit downloader with sorting options
   - Global search interface
   - Results preview area

2. **Queue & History Screen**:
   - Active downloads with progress bars
   - Completed downloads with status indicators
   - Download history with filtering options

3. **Settings Screen**:
   - Reddit authentication section
   - Download preferences
   - Application settings
   - Theme selection

## Technical Constraints
- UI will be implemented with PySide6 (Qt for Python)
- Support for both light and dark themes
- Responsive layout that works on different screen sizes
- All UI elements should have appropriate Qt class implementations

## Inspiration
- Look at modern media management applications like Spotify, YouTube Music
- Take cues from Reddit's own UI for familiarity
- Consider material design principles for clean, intuitive interfaces

## Deliverables Needed
1. Mockups of key screens (main download, queue/history, settings)
2. Color palette with hex codes for all UI elements
3. Font recommendations that complement the design
4. Icon suggestions for primary actions
5. Layout specifications with element spacing and sizing
6. Design recommendations for animations and transitions

The design should be modern, clean, and professional while maintaining a playful element through the purple and yellow color scheme. The interface should feel intuitive for users familiar with Reddit and provide clear visual feedback for all actions.
