# Image Prompt: Hex Card Forge - Gateway (Title Screen)

Create a digital illustration showcasing the Gateway screen (title/home screen) of the Hex Card Forge application.

## Visual Style
- **Art Style**: Dark fantasy/mystical interface with a clean, modern aesthetic
- **Medium**: Digital UI design illustration
- **Color Palette**: 
  * Primary: Rich Byzantine Purple (#4A0072)
  * Secondary: Goldenrod (#DAA520)
  * Background: Dark Imperial Blue (#1A1A2E)
  * Content Areas: Darker (#252538) and slightly lighter (#2C2C44) shades
  * Text: Light Gray (#E0E0E0) and Medium Gray (#B0B0B0)

## Key Elements to Include

1. **Background Effect**:
   - Dark imperial blue background with a subtle hexagonal pattern grid
   - Low opacity, light purple dots at grid intersections
   - A gentle pulsing animation effect (show this through subtle glow variation)

2. **Title Section**:
   - Large "HEX CARD FORGE" title text centered in the upper portion of the screen
   - "HEX" and "CARD" in white/light gray, "FORGE" in gold
   - Subtitle beneath: "Craft Your Legend, One Hex at a Time" in medium gray
   - Subtle upward animation effect (show this through a slight blur or motion lines)

3. **Hexagonal Menu Grid**:
   - Five prominent hexagonal buttons arranged in a loose grid pattern
   - Each button in rich purple with golden icon at the top
   - Include these options with appropriate icons:
     * "Create New Card" (magic wand icon)
     * "Card Library" (open book icon)
     * "Booster Packs" (open box icon)
     * "Design Template" (drafting compass icon)
     * "Image Tools" (crop tool icon)
   - One button should appear slightly enlarged/highlighted as if being hovered

4. **Visual Effects**:
   - Subtle particle or magic dust effects around menu buttons
   - Gold accent glow on interactive elements
   - Slight staggered appearance animation for the hex buttons
   - Depth effect with subtle shadows beneath hexagons

## Mood & Atmosphere
Create a mystical, arcane gateway that feels like the entrance to a digital grimoire. The interface should be elegant and mysterious, invoking the feeling of beginning a magical crafting journey. The dark background creates a theater-like atmosphere that makes the vibrant hexagonal menu options the stars of the show.

## Additional Notes
- Show the screen in a desktop aspect ratio (16:9)
- Include subtle motion hints or animation frames to suggest interactivity
- The UI should feel polished and premium while maintaining the arcane aesthetic
