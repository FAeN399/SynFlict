# Hex Card Forge - Project Status

**Date:** 2025-05-27
**Version:** 1.1 (CLI implementation complete; GUI development next)

## Current Progress Summary

### Completed Features:
1. **CLI Implementation** - Full command-line interface with Typer
   - Title screen with 5 menu options
   - Card creation wizard
   - Import/export functionality
   - Image cropping to hexagonal shape

2. **Core Data Model** - Card class with JSON serialization
   - Properties: uuid, title, metadata, imageFile, created, updated
   - Support for arbitrary key-value metadata
   - Serialization to/from JSON

3. **File Operations**
   - ZIP export/import of card data
   - Hex cropping of images with transparency

4. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for all core functionality
   - Card model tests
   - Serialization tests
   - Import/export tests
   - Image processing tests
   - Wizard flow tests

### Current Architecture:
- `cardforge/models.py` - Contains Card dataclass definition
- `cardforge/cli.py` - CLI implementation using Typer
- `cardforge/io.py` - Import/export functionality
- `cardforge/image.py` - Hex image cropping
- `cardforge/wizard.py` - Interactive card creation wizard
- `cardforge/tests/` - Test modules

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities:
1. **GUI Development** - Begin implementation based on the REFINED_UI_PROMPT.md design specs
   - Select GUI framework (likely Tkinter for cross-platform or PyQt for more advanced capabilities)
   - Implement "The Gateway" title screen with hexagonal menu design
   - Develop "The Scriptorium" card editor with form inputs and live preview

2. **Core GUI Components to Implement**:
   - Hexagonal card display with proper borders and styling
   - Form-based metadata editor that connects to existing wizard logic
   - Image upload and cropping interface ("The Visage Shaper")

3. **UI Integration**:
   - Connect existing CLI business logic to the new GUI components
   - Ensure all CLI functionality is accessible through the GUI
   - Maintain consistent theme using the purple and gold color scheme

### UI Enhancement Proposals:
- See `UI_DESIGN_PROMPT.md` and `REFINED_UI_PROMPT.md` for detailed design specifications
- Consider implementing the HTML/CSS concepts from the REFINED_UI_PROMPT as inspiration for the desktop GUI
- Maintain the hexagonal theme and dark purple/gold aesthetic throughout

### Outstanding Features (from todo.md):
- History stack (undo/redo functionality)
- Auto-save and multi-card session management
- Booster pack creation
- Error handling improvements
- Performance optimizations for larger card collections

## Development Guidelines

1. **Design Philosophy**: Maintain the mystical aesthetic with the purple and gold color scheme while ensuring functionality and usability

2. **Code Structure**: Continue using the modular approach with clear separation of concerns

3. **Testing**: Maintain high test coverage as new features are implemented

4. **Documentation**: Keep documentation up to date as the project evolves

5. **Priority**: Focus on core GUI functionality first, then implement more advanced features
