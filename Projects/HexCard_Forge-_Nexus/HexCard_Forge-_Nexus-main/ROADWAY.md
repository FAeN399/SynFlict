# Roadway: Starting Path for Human & AI Collaboration

This quick-start guide outlines a simple path (our "roadway") for you and the AI assistant to follow before building features.

1. **Review the Spec**
   - Read `spec.md` for project requirements and architecture.

2. **Consult the Prompt Plan**
   - `prompt_plan.md` lists incremental code-generation prompts.
   - Work through them sequentially to implement features testâ€‘first.

3. **Track Tasks**
   - Use `todo.md` as a checklist and update it as milestones are completed.

4. **Run Tests Early**
   - Execute `pnpm -r test` in the repo root to ensure all packages stay green.

5. **Iterate Together**
   - After each prompt, verify tests, review code, and plan next steps with the AI.

This roadway should help both human and AI contributors stay aligned from the very start.
