SPECIFICATION: Metaphysical Wrestling ‚Äì Fellowship as Ritualized Confrontation

‚ú¶ 1‚ÄÉPurpose & Premise

This spec outlines the framework for a ritual-theater experience called Metaphysical Wrestling, where participants explore conflict, friendship, ego, and transcendence through structured play, mythic roles, and emotionally honest confrontation.

It is not just a game. It is:

A forge for evolving identity

A ritual for transforming tension into growth

A theater for sacred comedy and tragedy

A brotherhood (or siblinghood) of reflective warriors

‚ú¶ 2‚ÄÉCore Philosophies

Concept

Description

Conflict is sacred

Wrestling = confrontation with one's shadow, pain, and pride

Brotherhood is creative

Participants are tag-team allies in myth, helping each other grow

The Gimmick is an Archetype

Personas are masks that reveal truth‚Äînot conceal it

Losing well is holy

"Doing the job" = allowing someone else to shine, so the story deepens

Repetition is alchemy

Matches, arguments, and performances refine character through practice

Play is spiritual

The fusion of comedy + drama reveals the soul's deeper truths

‚ú¶ 3‚ÄÉStructure & Flow

3.1 STAGE 1 ‚Äì THE PROMO (Declaration)

Participants speak in character (or heightened self) to declare a belief, challenge, or inner struggle.

Use metaphor and hype

Channel the drama: chant, monologue, scream, joke

Examples: "I am the Knight of Control, and I fear the fire of chaos..."

3.2 STAGE 2 ‚Äì THE MATCH (Dialogic Confrontation)

A non-violent ritual wrestling match through words, movement, posture, and creative expression.

Use a shared prompt or theme (e.g., "Truth vs Illusion")

Show your pain, but never humiliate

Tag each other in/out when one needs space

3.3 STAGE 3 ‚Äì THE FINISH (Narrative Synthesis)

One or both participants must "lose well," surrendering to the truth that emerged.

The outcome is agreed upon in the moment

The finish is symbolic: collapse, bow, hug, silent gesture

Celebrate with chanting or shared breath

3.4 STAGE 4 ‚Äì THE DEBRIEF (Heartfelt Reflection)

Drop the mask. Speak human-to-human.

What did the match reveal?

What changed in you?

What needs integration or rest?

‚ú¶ 4‚ÄÉRoles & Archetypes

Participants may choose or rotate symbolic identities:

The Phoenix ‚Äì Resurrecting from pain, proud and volatile

The Technician ‚Äì Precise, intellectual, seeks order

The Wild Card ‚Äì Chaos, emotion, spontaneity

The Healer ‚Äì Guides others through their wounds

The Mirror ‚Äì Reflects others, reveals blind spots
